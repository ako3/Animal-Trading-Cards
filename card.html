			<p>This bird has white feathers, with a yellow crest and a yellow patch under the wings.
				 They are intelligent, learn tricks easily and can get really affectionate. They can learn to imitate speech, but not as well as some parrots.
				 Every species of cockatoo lives in pairs of in groups, there are no solitary species. The group is used for safety and finding food, as more eyes spot predators and food quicker. The need to be part of a group is innate to cockatoos, just like dogs and people are naturally drawn to being part of a group.
